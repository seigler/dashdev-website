Metalsmith could be used to create any number of resources, including:

* a fast static website with minimal server-side requirements
* technical documentation
* an eBook
* application prototypes
* build tools or project scaffolding

The markdown files can be converted to other files types using plugins such as [metalsmith-pandoc](https://github.com/arve0/metalsmith-pandoc) or [metalsmith-pdf](https://github.com/jjclark1982/metalsmith-pdf).
