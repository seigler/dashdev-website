All files in the `src` folder can be edited:

* pages are created as markdown files in the `src/html` folder and sub-folders.
* static assets such as CSS, JavaScript and image files are created in `src/assets`. These are copied without modification to `build/`.
* page templates are defined in `src/template`.
* reusable partials (chunks of HTML code) are declared in `src/partials`.
